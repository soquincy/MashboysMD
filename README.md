# MashboysMD

This is the source code for the BPM spreadsheets for the Mashboys Tracker. You must provide your own CSV/ODS (OpenDocument Spreadsheet file).
This HTML file simply parses the tracker for better search functionality.

## Features
- Can searach all songs provided in the current tracker: inculding BPMs, Keys, and notes.
- Can also search by artist, title, or both

## Issues
- It gets confused with some entries, especially variable BPMs and keys. *I will fix this soon.*
